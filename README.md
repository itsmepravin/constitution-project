## [Live Website](https://constitution-project.vercel.app/)

## A personal project to make the Constitution of Nepal into a website.

## The official pdf provides all the information about the laws of Nepal.

## But going through 240 pages just to find "What are my rights as a citizen?" is not optimal.

## That is why I started this project. This also helps people to stay away from misinformation rabbithole,

## portrayed by online medias, influencers and people with agendas.

## This is still a work-in-progress and I do the best of my ability to keep updating

## the information inside.

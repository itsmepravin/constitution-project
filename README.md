## [Live Website Here](https://constitution-project.vercel.app/)

A personal project to make the Constitution of Nepal into a website. The official pdf provides all the information about the Constitution of Nepal but going through 240 pages just to find "What are my rights as a citizen?" is not optimal. That is why I started this project. This also helps people to stay away from misinformation rabbithole, portrayed by online medias, influencers and people with agendas. This is still a work-in-progress and I do the best of my ability to keep updating the information inside.
